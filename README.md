# SurgeryOCR

## Description

Analyzes ophthalmological surgery videos to extract and label on-screen numerical data representing different surgical stages using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

## Project Goals

This project aims to automate the extraction and labeling of critical numerical data displayed within ophthalmological surgery videos. By leveraging Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques, the repository provides tools to:

* Identify and extract numerical values appearing on the video feed.
* Label these extracted numbers based on the specific stage of the surgery they correspond to.
* Provide a structured dataset for further analysis of surgical procedures, potentially leading to insights for research, training, and quality improvement in ophthalmology.

## Key Features

* **Video Analysis:** Processes ophthalmological surgery videos as input.
* **On-Screen OCR:** Employs OCR to recognize numerical data displayed on the video frames.
* **Stage Identification:** (Optional, but good to mention if planned) Aims to identify different stages of the surgery to provide context to the extracted data.
* **Data Labeling:** Labels the extracted numerical data according to the identified surgical stage (if stage identification is implemented).
* **Output:** Generates structured output (e.g., CSV, JSON) containing the extracted numerical data and their corresponding labels and timestamps.
